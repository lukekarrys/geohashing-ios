# Getting Started

## Local
- `npm install`

- Launch Xcode and build for iOS Simulator *(this should only need to be done once)*

## Release
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- Once server is ready `npm run release`
- Launch Xcode and do the following from the [React Native Debugging Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html#debugging-react-native-apps): *To disable the developer menu for production builds, open your project in Xcode and select `Product` → `Scheme` → `Edit Scheme...` (or press `⌘ + <`). Next, select `Run` from the menu on the left and change the Build Configuration to `Release`.*
